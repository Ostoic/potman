# potman
potman (Potfile Manager) is a small tool/lib I wrote for working with Hashcat potfiles. It currently supports basic lookup (essid, password) and dump (essid, password, all, etc) operations. I used this project as a way to understand how to use nom better, seeing as most of this could be done in a simple bash script.
